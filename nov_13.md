Establishing Among Us Mondays (Amongdays)
- Exi objects but nobody cares

S3 will start between December 26 and mid Janruary

Red sus sand is required before s3 starts 
- other blocks and items don't need to be done by season start

We will do a map mod eventually in the future

Shears 2 - shear recipe crafted with shears instead of iron

Guillotines

Rules mod
- In chat like the data pack
- Players are in adventure mode and prevented from moving untill they accept rules

Discord integration
- Send a message in a discord channel when a new player joins
- Verification and unverifying players when they leave the Discord

Travel posters and other assorted propaganda

The archives are probably the only location that get a custom biome but ender can have void biome in some places because funny

Gamerules to discuss: 
- Creepers drop all blocks
- Snow layers more than one
- Fire tick off
- Sleep percentage 0 (if there's a mod to speed up time depending on how many players are sleeping then we should use that)
